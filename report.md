# Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment – Summary Report

## Methodology
Trader-level execution data was aggregated at a daily level and aligned with Bitcoin Fear & Greed sentiment data. Key behavioral and performance metrics such as daily PnL, trade frequency, average trade size, and long/short bias were engineered. Comparisons were made across Fear and Greed regimes, along with trader segmentation analysis.

## Key Insights
1. Trader performance deteriorates during Fear periods, with lower average PnL and higher downside variability.
2. Greed periods lead to increased trade frequency and larger position sizes, but without proportional improvement in win rates.
3. Consistent traders maintain profitability across both Fear and Greed regimes, while inconsistent traders suffer higher losses during Fear.

## Strategy Recommendations
1. During Fear sentiment, reduce trade frequency and cap position sizes for high-frequency traders to limit drawdowns.
2. During Greed sentiment, allow increased activity only for traders with historically high win rates, while restricting exposure for inconsistent traders.
